# Database Interface (client + api)
Database Interface (Node | Javascript | React | MySQL)

The example database in use is a mysql DB within a Docker container.

Originally the idea was to just use this client as a visualization tool for basically any mysql database. So it first makes a query to figure out all the tables within the given database and then dynamically creates the appropriate React components based on the results of the query.

Eventually it needed to be expanded to include a lot more functionality like adding, removing and updating objetcs. However due to time constraints, all of these weren't finished and the final result is more like a demo than a fully developed product (might be finished later).

Later [Material UI](https://mui.com/ "Material UI") elements were also implemented to make the visual side of the project more pleasing.
