# Database Interface (client + api)
Database Interface (Node | Javascript | React | MySQL)

- The example database in use is a mysql DB within a Docker container.

- Originally the idea was to just use this client as a visualization tool for basically any MySQL database. So we would first make a query to figure out all the tables within the given database and then dynamically create the appropriate React components based on the results of the query.

- Eventually the project needed to be expanded to include a lot more functionality like adding, removing and updating objetcs. However due to time constraints, all of these weren't finished and the final result is more like a demo than a fully developed product (might be finished later).

- Later on [Material UI](https://mui.com/ "Material UI") elements were also implemented to make the visual side of the project more pleasing.
